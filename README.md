# CSCI-561-Artificial-Intelligence-course-at-USC
All the assignments covered as part of the course CSCI 561: Foundations of Artificial Intelligence by Prof. Laurent Itti at USC

The 3 assignments comprehensively covered various topics of Aritificial Intelligence. Given below is a brief description of each of the assignments.

## HW1 - Search
Given an mxn matrix, a number of targets and a starting point, and a few constraints, the shortest point to each of the targets is to be calculated using each of the three algorithms.

Algorithms implemented: DFS, BFS, A* 

Language: Python

## HW2 - Minimax Game Playing - Halma (Chinese Checkers)
A program has been written that takes as input the board state at that moment, and generates an optimal move using alpha beta pruning to be taken by the player in the given time. 

Algorithm implemented: Alpha-beta pruning 

Language: Java

## HW3 - Logic
Implemented a First Order Logic Resolution engine for sentences in CNF form. This uses unification of sentences, including variable to variable unification.

Algorithms implemeted: Unification, Resolution

Language: Python
